This repository is mainly for projects I have done under DataQuest.

DataQuest online data analyst programe helped me to learn  clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 
I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .
