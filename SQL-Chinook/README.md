Ansering Bussiness questions using SQL

In this project I worked with the Chinook database ,a music collection involving track name, albums ,artists, genre and sales.
My objective was to answer business questions in complex SQL queries using advance SQL concept like JOINs, subqueries, multiple joins, set operations, aggregate functions and database view .
I imported the modules that will allow connection to the chinook database, execute queries and fetch results.
